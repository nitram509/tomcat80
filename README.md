# Tomcat 8.0.x pimped with brotli compression support

Experimental revise of [Tomcat 8.0.x](http://tomcat.apache.org)
to provide Google's [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) compression.

It uses [jbrotli](https://github.com/nitram509/jbrotli) Java implementation.


##### Status of this project

‚ùå **CANCELED**

The original idea was to improve Tomcat code base with Brotli support.
After discussion with Tomcat committers it turns out they will not include
Brotli support into code base, not even putting it on a roadmap.

If you wanna use Brotli compression in your web application, have a look
at the [BrotliServletFilter](https://github.com/meteogroup/jbrotli) in jbrotli

Now, this code is only meant for learning exercise.

## How to build

Currently the build process requires manual work.
You need to have ```tomcat80``` and ```jbrotli``` checked out side by side.

```
+- your-project-folder
  |
  +- tomcat80
  +- jbrotli
```

1. Build jbrotli
   * see [README.md](https://github.com/nitram509/jbrotli/blob/master/README.md) for details
2. Build tomcat80
   * simply run ```ant``` in the project folder

Attention: currently the win32-x86-64 platform libs are hard-wired.
You may need to adopt Tomcat's ```build.xml``` to choose you correct platform.
   

## How to run

1. switch to folder ```output/build/bin```
2. as usual, run ```startup.bat``` or ```startup.sh```
